# Introduction

Using Jupyter docker image to not deal with installing dependencies on your machine.
Just install [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), then run `docker-compose up` and you're all set :)

The notebook will be exposed on your local machine at port `8888`.
